# Ask for help on Slack

The [govdatascience Slack](govdatascience.slack.com) is a friendly place to ask
for help from other people in the civil service.  Here are some ways you can
use it, and make it easier for people to help you.

The channels #r and #python are good channels to ask questions specific to those
languages.  There are other good channels for different topics, like machine
learning and APIs.  The #rap_collaboration channel is good for topics that
aren't specific to a language or technique, but are about working according the
the RAP methodology.

## What I've got, what I want

This type of question is for when you are writing code to do something very
specific. Try to write a very simple example example of the output you want, and
the input you have.

> I'm trying to transform my data from 'long' to 'wide' format, but I'm getting
> stuck. Here's an example of with some fake data.  Grateful for any
> suggestions!

```{r}
# What I've got
dummy <- tibble::tibble(run = c("a", "a", "b", "b"),
                        event = c("x", "y", "x", "y"),
                        score = 1:4)

# What I want
wiw <- tibble::tibble(run = c("a", "b"),
                      x = c(1L, 3L),
                      y = c(2L, 4L))
```

Why ask a question this way?

* It doesn't have to use your actual data, so you don't have to worry
about exposing sensitive data.
* It is easy for the person helping you to set up your situation, and know when
  they have solved it.  They don't have to invent an example themselves.
* The process of writing down the problem will often help you to solve it
  yourself.

## Has anyone used X package or Y technique?

This question to ask in the the #rap_collaboration or #general channels, as well
as the language-specific #r or #python channels if they are relevant.  Ask this
kind of question when you

* want to know if an idea is feasible
* aren't sure that your knowledge is up to date
* would like to start by modifying someone else's existing code

If you find the answers useful, contribute them to this website by taking some
notes and writing an article, or by discussing it in the #rap_collaboration
channel.

## Ask a question somewhere else

RStudio gives [advice](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) on asking for help in
various places, including Stack Overflow, community.rstudio.com and Twitter, and
provides the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) to help you write
reproducible examples.

For Python users, the same principles are still sound, and the package [reprexpy](https://pypi.org/project/reprexpy/) package is helps you to write reproducible examples.

# Introducing the RAP website

By Duncan Garmonsway on 5 April 2019

## The RAP website is for us

The RAP community writes heaps of useful documents.  We blog in various places.
We write tutorials, style guides, standards, business cases, snippets of code to
help each other out.  We share them within our own departments and on
[Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com/messages/C6H22U3H9/)
(#rap_collaboration).  Now we can publish on this website too.

## It isn't finished yet

It is barely started.  It has an 'alpha' phase banner, which means "let's try
this, and if it doesn't work then we can junk it".  It has a feedback link to
the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/rap-website/issues),
where we can discuss specifics, or we can chat about it on Slack.

## It's Web 2.0

It isn't really Web 2.0 because it's a static site created with the R package
[govdown](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/) (basically R Markdown).
But it *is* for all of us to write content.  We've already written plenty of
content, so let's put it here.

You can contribute content by discussing yours or someone else's in Slack, or by
opening an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/rap-website/issues).  Look at the
[RAP Companion issues](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/rap_companion/issues)
for ideas.  Python content would be great -- there's almost none yet, mainly
because the people who wrote the RAP Companion weren't pythonistas at the time.

## It doesn't replace the Champions Network page or any others

The [RAP Champions
Network](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/about-us/champion-networks/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions)
is coordinated by the Government Statistical Service, who maintain a list of
people to contact for help, a list of examples of RAP projects, and links to
blog posts, guides and courses.  Several blog posts have already been published
in official blogs on blog.gov.uk.  It is better to publish on those websites if
you can (and we can link to them from here).  This website hopefully augments
those by being a place to write technical content with code blocks, and try
things out that aren't ready to be on the GOV.UK domain.

## Accessibility matters

This website is only as good as its accessibility.  It has been built with
accessible components from the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), and will be tested in an
[empathy
lab](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/20/creating-the-uk-governments-accessibility-empathy-lab/).  Please tell someone if you notice a problem.

## Have a look around

Follow the links in the black banner at the top of the page and tell us what you
think.

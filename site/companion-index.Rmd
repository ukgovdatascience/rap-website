# RAP Companion and Course

The RAP Companion is an online book about RAP.  The [original
book](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/) was written by Matt
Upson and Matt Gregory in 2017 and has been updated since with contributions by
other people.

[Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) using
R](https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines) is a free online
course that draws on the RAP Companion, with examples and exercises in the R
programming language.

The articles linked below are copies of the original RAP Companion.  Some users
might find these versions more accessible because this website uses accessible
components from the GOV.UK Design System.

## Future of the RAP Companion

The RAP Companion will not be extensively updated.  New
[articles](articles.html) can be written and published on this website instead.
The reason not to update the RAP Companion is because that would require the
[online course videos](https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines)
to be updated too, which would be difficult to do collaboratively.  Rather than
allow the Companion to diverge from the course videos, the Companion will be
preserved, and new and revised material will be published on this website.

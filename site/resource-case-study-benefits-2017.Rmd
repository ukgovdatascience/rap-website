# Benefits to government from Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

By Jonah Peter Adaun, Matt Gregory and Matt Upson, in 2017.

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

This case study looks at the benefits of using Reproducible Analytical Pipelines
(RAP) in producing official national statistics. Open source tools have been
used to reproduce statistics in 3 departments: MOJ, DCMS and DFE.

We have looked at the process before (see Figure 1 below) and after (see Figure
2 below) software development skills have been gained by the analysts. This has
been used to estimate the potential efficiency savings from adopting RAP across
government. There are also qualitative benefits such as building capability to
use a programming language to making the quality assurance process simpler. (See
wider benefits section below)

GDS has previously blogged about RAP and on the potential for it to transform
the process of producing official statistics. This included collaborative
efforts with statisticians and data scientists in the above departments used in
this case study. These blogs also discuss the journey to engage cross-government
and others with the ideas of RAP such as departmental heads of statistics
profession.

We have blogged about this work on the GOV.UK website in [March
2017](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/)
and [November
2017](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/27/transforming-the-process-of-producing-official-statistics/).

### Official statistics production process

Producing official statistics for publications is a key function of many teams
across government. It can be a time-consuming and meticulous process to ensure
that statistics are accurate and timely. With open source software becoming more
widely used, there are now a range of tools and techniques that can be used to
reduce production time, whilst maintaining and even improving the quality of
publications.

The process for official statistics production in Government varies widely
across departments. The short description here is not definitive, but processes
often have some or all of the following steps:

### What RAP does

RAP borrows ideas from software development and academia to automate
time-consuming processes of data assembly, verification and integration,
generation of charts and tables, and set up and populate statistical reports.
There are potential efficiency savings for analysts, freeing them up to focus on
the interpretation of the results - turning four steps into one using a file
format that allows intermingling of code and prose. This process effectively
turns analysis into high quality documents, reports, presentation or dashboards
that can be easily reproduced.

RAP reduces the number of stages in the statistical production process which
saves time, money and also improving the quality assurance of publications by
analysts. The main savings come from reduced time spent manually doing quality
assurance of the process outlined in Figure 1. Instead, RAP enshrines business
and statistical knowledge into code and documentation as part of a software
package. However, there are also the costs of analysts learning an open source
language which are factored into estimating the benefits from using this method.

## Method

This case study has looked at the benefits of RAP from several departments:
DCMS, MOJ and DFE. We have generalised the average staff time savings per
publication (or efficiency gains after RAP skills have been acquired) to other
official national statistical publications.

We have monetised the benefits of analysts using RAP by looking at the time it
took to produce the publication compared to after RAP skills have been acquired.
This method also includes the time spent building up capability to use the
method.

We have generalised the average efficiency savings (£8.8k) from the case study
to approximately 17,000 statistical publications across government. We estimate
between £90m and £149m efficiency savings depending on the number of official
statistical publications that benefit from RAP. There are a further 1,462
upcoming publications that could also benefit from RAP but are yet to be
released.

### Efficiency savings 1

This benefit refers to the total estimated efficiency savings once RAP skills
have been acquired on average for each publication.

We have estimated this using approx. 17k statistical publications across
government (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics). There are a further
approximately 1.4k upcoming statistics that could also benefit from RAP which
have not been released. We have allowed for a margin of error in our estimates.

Table: Estimated efficiency savings from stats publications

| Number of publications RAP benefits	| Average annual saving per publication	| Total |
|------------------------------------:|--------------------------------------:|------:|
| 16,965 (100%)	                      | £8.8k	                                | £149M |
| 13,572 (80%)	                      | £8.8k	                                | £119M |
| 10,179 (60%)	                      | £8.8k	                                | £90M  |

### Efficiency savings 2

This is based on the average savings from our case study per publication on an
annual basis -  also once RAP skills have been acquired. RAP is most beneficial
for publications that are more frequent. Official stats publications that are a
one-off might not benefit from RAP due to the time and effort required for an
analyst to learn the skills and for the code to be developed.

#### Average annual saving per publication

<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-size-80">£8.8k</p>

This is the annual monetised efficiency saving or gains (across 4 publications:
3 in Department for Education and 1 In Digital Culture Media and Sport) in year
2 once the initial costs in year 1 (approx. £2.5k in case studies) of learning
RAP techniques in R or other programming language.

## Wider benefits

Beyond the efficiency savings, other benefits come from building a process that
is fully transparent, auditable and verifiable – reducing risk and improving
quality. The result has been the delivery of RAP to automate the production of
statistical reports across Government.

Qualitative benefits of RAP include:

1. Transfers software development best practice into the statistical domain
1. Reduced risk of knowledge loss e.g. when people move jobs
1. More robust and timely analysis compared to traditional methods
1. Transparent analysis and quality assurance
1. Builds staff capabilities enabling them to use a programming language
1. Morale boost for analysts through automating laborious tasks
1. RAP can allow analysts to rationalise the process and leverage datasets to
   speed handling of detailed Parliamentary Questions and Freedom of Information
   requests
1. Online resource built called a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) and freely
   available online for analysts in government and elsewhere to use. This
   resource also captures data as students complete the course.

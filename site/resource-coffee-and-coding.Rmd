# Coffee and coding

The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a
vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at an organisation. Coffee &
Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within an organisation who are
interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance
to each other and generally network and get to know each other.

A common format is 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the
presenter/s followed by 20 minutes Code Surgery. The presentations usually take
the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of
work done within the department using these methods.  The Code Surgery provides
the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas
to the gathered coding community.

Some sessions are live-streamed and recorded.  Contact presenters or organisers
for material (videos, slides, notes) that isn't publicly available -- it might
be possible for them to share it with you directly.

Offers to present sessions in other deparments are often gratefully accepted.

# NHS NSS Transforming Publications Toolkit

The NHS NSS Transforming Publishing team has created a toolkit of templates,
guides and resources to support the modernisation of both the back end
production of statistical products ([Reproducible Analytical
Pipelines](#reproducible-analytical-pipelines)) and the user-facing output of
statistical products to a digital platform ([Transformed
Publications](#examples-of-transformed-publications)). These tools will also be helpful when
moving from a proprietary software such as SPSS or SAS, to an open source
software such as R for any statistical analyses. If you have any questions about
this toolkit then please contact the team at
nss.isdtransformingpublishing@nhs.net and they would be delighted to help.

The original version of this toolkit is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/Toolkit/blob/master/README.md).
Sections of it that are relevant to all RAP projects are republished and
slightly adapted here.

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

Reproducible Analytical Pipelines are a way to introduce a robust, efficient and
reproducible work flow when carrying out data analysis. They have traditionally
been applied to statistical publications, but the principles are relevant to any
analysis.

### Guidance and templates

- [This
  paper](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf)
  explains what Reproducible Analytical Pipelines are, how to assess whether
  your work is suitable to ‘RAP’ and details several levels of code maturity and
  RAP which can be selected depending on a number of factors, such as the skill
  in your team or the available IT infrastructure.
- The [PHI R Style
  Guide](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/PHI%20R%20style%20guide.md)
  is for analysts to follow when writing any R code, to make it consistent,
  readable, shareable and reusable.  You might like to adopt or adapt it in your
  own department.
- PHI uses a recommended [R project
  structure](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/r-project-structure)
  when writing R code to ensure a sensible workflow and structure.
  An R project which follows the
  recommended structure can be created from within RStudio using the new
  [phiproject
  package](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/phiproject).
- Templates like the [National Statistic publication
  templates](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/RMarkdown)
  can be used to automate PDF reports using Rmarkdown.

### Further resources

- [This app](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/nhs-r-resources/) contains a range of
  resources for R, such as links to online training and cheatsheets, and
  information about internal R user groups.
- The Transforming Publishing team also has a [resources
  area](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/resources), with
  useful resources on technical issues such as version control.
- There is [GitHub
  guidance](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/GitHub-guidance)
  on workflow and security when using git for version control.

## Examples of transformed publications

ISD has developed a new web-based way of releasing statistical publications to
our users and has now released two publications in this format: [Acute Hospital
Activity and
Beds](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Hospital-Care/Publications/2018-12-18/acute-hospital-publication/?49401491881)
and [Psychiatric Inpatient
Activity](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Mental-Health/Publications/2018-09-25/psychiatric-inpatient-activity/).
This new design has been developed with users at the heart of the process, and
incorporates elements of static text, D3 charts, RShiny dashboards and open
data.

### User engagement

It is vital that users are part of the development, or re-development, of a
statistical publication so that their needs are met. This means involving users
before, during and after development.

### Transforming output

There is a [blank RShiny
template](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/rshiny-project-structure)
to use when starting to build a new app or dashboard to ensure you have a
sensible workflow and structure.

Here are examples of ISD's existing RShiny dashboards for good practice in terms
of both coding and design:

* [Psychiatric Inpatient Activity Data Explorer
  code](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/Psychiatric-Inpatient-Activity)
* [Acute Activity Data Explorer
  code](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/Hospital-Acute-Activity).

# RAP: Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

The Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) is a methodology for automating the
bulk of steps involved in creating a statistical report.

RAP is also a community of people who work with data using methods adapted from
software development.  The RAP community promotes the use of programming
languages, version control, automated testing, peer review, and other tools and
methods.

This website is a place for the community to publish materials that it finds
useful.  In particular, materials that include code can be published on this
website.

## Other RAP websites

The [RAP Champions
network](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/about-us/champion-networks/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions)
is coordinated by the Government Statistical Service, who maintain a list of
people to contact for help, a list of examples of RAP projects, and links to
blog posts, guides and courses.
